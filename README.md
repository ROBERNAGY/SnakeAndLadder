# SnakeAndLadder
This project is a digital version of the classic Snake and Ladder board game, developed using C++ with Object-Oriented Programming principles and structured programming techniques. The game uses the SFML library to create an interactive graphical interface, allowing players to roll dice, move across the board, and interact with snakes and ladders. It supports multiple players, turn-based gameplay, and provides a fun, animated experience while reinforcing key programming concepts like class design, event handling, and game loop structure.
